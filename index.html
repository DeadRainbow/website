								<p>
									Danny Phantom is an American animated television show created by Butch Hartman for Nickelodeon,
									produced by Billionfold Studios. It originally ran from April 3, 2004 to August 24, 2007.
								</p>
								<p>
									The show is about Danny Fenton, a teenage boy who gained ghost powers through an accident in his
									parents' lab, who takes on the alter ego of Danny Phantom to save his town and the world from ghost
									attacks, all while struggling through school and his teenage life. Throughout its run, Danny Phantom
									received five Annie Award nominations and generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, with
									praise primarily directed at its ensemble cast and comic book-influenced themes and storyline. Hartman
									himself has noted that the series is arguably his most popular and acclaimed work, despite its
									relatively short production life compared to The Fairly OddParents. Additionally, Danny Phantom has
									spawned video games, home video releases, toys, and various other merchandise.

											The older sister of Danny Fenton, and a main

											only doesn't say anything until he's ready as well as help keep his secret, but begins to realize
											her brother is growing up. Once Danny accepts that Jazz knows, they become much closer.

											eat horse meat during the war. It is not known if this is true or if he was just rambling. He
											has an ancestor named John Fentonightingale who lived during the time of the Salem Witch
											Trials, with whom he shares his looks and obsessiveness, indicating that contact with the
											paranormal seems to run in his family.
